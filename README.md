# DDA-Algorithm
 🧮 DDA Line Drawing Algorithm (Python + Matplotlib)

This project demonstrates the **Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA)line drawing algorithm using Python. The DDA algorithm is a fundamental computer graphics technique used to draw straight lines between two points by incrementally calculating intermediate pixel positions.

Features:

* Implementation of DDA line drawing from scratch.
* Step-by-step coordinate calculation and visualization.
* Graphical representation using Matplotlib.
* Simple and educational code suitable for learning basic computer graphics.

How to Run:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the Python script in any environment with `matplotlib` installed.
3. The line between the specified coordinates will be plotted on a graph.
